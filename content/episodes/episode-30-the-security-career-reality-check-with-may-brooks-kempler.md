  Let’s be honest: Not everyone’s cut out to be the boss, and those who are often don’t want the job. That’s especially true in security, where many people consider the role of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) more of a sentence than a promotion. Executive, author, podcaster and recovering CISO May Brooks-Kempler gives us her take on whether sitting in the big chair is all it’s cracked up to be, as well as her unorthodox take on privacy that’ll get you thinking.

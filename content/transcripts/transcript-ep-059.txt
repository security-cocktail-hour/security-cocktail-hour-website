Welcome to the Security Cocktail Hour.
0:07
I'm Joe Patti.
0:08
I'm Adam Roth.
0:10
Adam, it looks like today we are doing
0:12
another unboxing. One of our favorite
0:16
things to do.
0:17
You know how I like to eat healthy with
0:19
some grapes.
0:20
Yeah,
0:21
maybe some cherries,
0:23
various fruits and whatnot.
0:25
Yeah.
0:25
Yeah. Yeah,
0:26
but this is a WiFi pineapple.
0:30
Oh, what a segue. You're getting good at
0:32
this. Awesome.
0:33
I'm a certified professional segueist.
0:36
Well done.
0:36
GPS.
0:38
Okay, so the the Wi-Fi pineapple. Now,
0:40
this is something that at one time was
0:43
very obscure, but a lot of people got to
0:46
know about uh because of TV. Something
0:48
something on TV that was actually real
0:50
for a change, right?
0:52
Yeah. I mean, a lot of a lot of these
0:57
James Bondish, Jason Bourne, you know,
1:00
hacker movies, they they use a lot of
1:03
Hack Five um devices and they're
1:06
actually really good for pen testing.
1:08
That's the company that makes this Hack
1:10
Five.
1:10
Yes. So, I apologize for not identifying
1:13
who they are, but Hack Five has come out
1:16
with a lot of different um technology
1:18
that's used uh uh like Spider-Man, you
1:22
know, um using it for good, you know.
1:25
That's right. For good, not evil. These
1:27
things are all good. We did an episode
1:28
on that
1:29
on how to use these ethically.
1:31
Um now, I see on the box, cuz I can
1:34
read, what does it say? Mark 7 or
1:36
something. This
1:37
So, these have been around for a while.
1:39
This is not anything new, right? And
1:42
they've had a lot of iterations.
1:44
I mean, they they use a lot of really
1:46
playful, good marketing names, rubber
1:48
ducky and, you know, turtle and um
1:52
things of that nature. And this one is
1:55
called the pineapple. Um not sure why it
1:59
doesn't look like a pineapple, but they
2:01
do use colorful graphics and marketing
2:04
to market everything. And this is the
2:06
pineapple.
2:08
I don't know. I guess I'm outing myself
2:10
as a dad. When I see that little
2:11
pineapple, I think of as Spongebob, not
2:13
hacking, but whatever.
2:16
So, I'm going to do my best. Um, I
2:19
really haven't done a lot of use uh of
2:22
the hacking hack 5 devices, but the
2:24
pineapple is supposed to be basically
2:27
kind of of a pentest uh device. It's
2:30
used to um create um hotspots. People
2:35
you hope people connect to them. you uh
2:38
you identify the information, you use it
2:40
as a man-in-the-middle attack. Uh it can
2:42
be used for a lot of different things
2:43
with Wi-Fi and uh this is their premier
2:48
number one uh Wi-Fi um device. Uh they
2:53
have books on it. This is the box.
2:57
They they discuss uh uh how to place it,
3:00
I believe.
3:02
than the pineapple itself. Uh it's just
3:05
this is the back of the back of the box
3:06
with the antennas. There's more you can
3:08
add to this. They have these high pickup
3:10
antennas you can buy. Uh it says triple
3:13
discrete MT radios power over USB-C
3:17
integrated USB Ethernet host port dual
3:20
eMMC and SPI flash. Basically what it's
3:23
saying is it's basically a high
3:25
performance device and it's capable of
3:28
uh doing a lot of uh different things.
3:31
The standards are 802.11bgn.
3:34
The interfaces are Ethernet over USB USB
3:38
2 ho 2.0 host wireless AP and the
3:41
antennas are RPS SMAs. So it's really
3:44
nice USB 5V 2 amp and 2.4 gigahertz. Oh,
3:50
I always try to go for the five-fold two
3:52
amp. That's very cool. But, uh,
3:54
yeah,
3:54
but this is as you open as you start to
3:57
open that up,
3:58
um, you know, we're always talking about
4:00
when you go to a public place and you
4:02
got to be careful that someone might do
4:04
a man-in-the-middle attack, you might
4:06
connect to an untrusted network. Um,
4:09
this might be what the bad guys are
4:12
using that you should be worried about.
4:13
This is not the only thing. And this is
4:15
kind of the more accessible I don't want
4:18
to say consumery version because it's
4:20
not really consumer, but this isn't uh
4:23
super spy stuff. And and if you really
4:26
think about it, right, if there's a high
4:27
gain antenna in here and you're using
4:29
the SSID of the airport, like you're
4:31
walking around and somebody turns around
4:34
and puts uh and it says the sticker, it
4:37
says uh the the uh kiosk says use
4:40
airport open or open airport and then
4:43
you do open airport on this and people
4:45
connect to it, but you're also connected
4:47
to the internet. You're creating a
4:49
man-in-the-middle attack and people
4:50
think it's a regular device. or if you
4:52
go into like a T-Mobile or an AT&T or
4:56
something like that and they have and
4:57
there really isn't
4:59
um a connectivity for there but your Mac
5:03
your Windows machine is already knows to
5:06
pick up this device and you emulate what
5:09
normally those carriers would do. How
5:12
you going to know the difference,
5:13
right? And you got to be clear to this
5:15
thing we're going to see how big it is.
5:17
It's not big. um you hide it or you put
5:19
in a knapsack or a bag or something. Um
5:22
it's not like you're going to actually
5:23
see this. You just see the name of the
5:25
network. It pops up on your phone or
5:27
your laptop or whatever it is.
5:29
The first thing we're going to look at,
5:31
we're going to look at the beautiful uh
5:34
I'm going to try to do my best to pick
5:35
it to the camera, but it's um you know,
5:39
for clarity, I might just go a little
5:40
lower, but it's a it's a little kind of
5:43
like business card that folds. And I'm
5:45
going to take it to my myself and read
5:47
it. It basically tells you how to
5:49
connect it to the power source, what
5:51
network you can join, and how to
5:52
configure it. And then it has a little
5:56
bit of information here about what each
5:58
of the lights do. There's a blinking
5:59
blue means it's starting up. And a solid
6:02
blue, it's ready. And a solid red uh red
6:05
means invalid USB files and alternating
6:07
blue and red. Flashing firmware. Do not
6:10
unplug power. So, you don't want to
6:12
brick the device.
6:14
No. Does it have the FCC compliance on
6:16
there? I I always check that.
6:17
Oh, that's really important. So, I I'm
6:19
sure it's somewhere located here, but
6:21
yeah.
6:22
And I'll bet you can probably put
6:23
illegal firmware on it to actually break
6:25
that
6:26
like like some people who stuff
6:29
who who uh like siloed it, right? So,
6:32
now we're going to be ready to uh uh
6:34
take it out of the bag.
6:36
Yes. Let's see it. It's like Christmas
6:38
morning. I'm dying here.
6:39
I'm Jewish.
6:44
Okay.
6:44
All right. It's like I don't know what
6:45
night do you get your presents?
6:46
It's like holiday night that is. It's
6:48
like the holidays.
6:49
So, it has locations for the antennas.
6:53
Mhm.
6:54
It has a USB C and USBA port.
6:58
The antennas are in the box. It comes
6:59
with antennas, right?
7:00
Yes, sir.
7:01
Of course.
7:02
So, let's start putting them on, right?
7:05
All right.
7:09
And it And we can't tell on screen, but
7:11
is it heavy? I mean, is this something
7:13
you can like velcro to the underside of
7:15
a table or something?
7:16
Absolutely.
7:17
Really? Wow, that's nasty.
7:19
And then for And then these devices to
7:21
these days, these battery packs are so
7:24
small that you don't even need to
7:26
connect it to, you know, live power. You
7:28
just connect it to a battery pack.
7:29
Oh, that's right.
7:31
Yeah. It could run for quite a while.
7:33
Then someone goes
7:35
and picks it up.
7:37
A lot of people who do pentests, what
7:39
they end up doing is they end up putting
7:42
this close in proximity to where you
7:44
would normally log in.
7:47
Maybe they'll shut out the other uh
7:50
SSID.
7:51
Maybe they'll um maybe they'll uh uh
7:56
maybe they'll overpower it with this
7:58
device because it's closer. And that's
8:01
what you're going to log into. And then
8:03
we have the USB itself,
8:08
the cable.
8:09
Oh, USB cable. That's cool.
8:12
USBC. And I believe there's nothing else
8:15
in the box.
8:17
That's it. That's pretty
8:17
straightforward, actually.
8:19
Yeah.
8:20
Now, I think what we're going to do,
8:22
right, is we're going to I have an
8:24
abundance of Hack Five devices. And I
8:27
think what we're going to do here is uh
8:29
the next go around and actually I'm
8:32
going to travel soon. So I'm going to
8:34
see if I can use this possibly as a
8:36
travel router. I haven't tried that yet.
8:39
Uh but we'll try that out. And then the
8:42
next um episode that we'll come out with
8:45
eventually will be how to use it to the
8:48
command and control that Hack 5 gives
8:50
you and you can pay yearly for to manage
8:52
your devices. So, if you took this
8:54
device, this pineapple, and you put it
8:57
at one location, and then you took
8:59
another pineapple and you were able to
9:01
connect it to the internet as well in
9:03
another location, you can manage these
9:05
devices remotely using the command and
9:06
control.
9:08
Uh, that's scary if you're not using it
9:10
for good. But got to understand what
9:12
people can do with this stuff. Um, you
9:15
know what would be cool if when you're
9:17
traveling if you take that travel router
9:19
we looked at and see if you can use this
9:21
to like break the travel router
9:24
and like get on the cool
9:27
if you're in the hotel room and got
9:29
nothing to do, right?
9:31
Yeah, definitely. Or I I and I'm joking.
9:33
I was going to say I'm going to see if
9:34
the people next door will connect, but
9:36
I'm joking. I'm joking.
9:37
Yeah, test it on them. Right.
9:41
All right. Well, that's pretty cool.
9:43
That's interesting. I have heard about
9:45
these for years. Obviously, they've been
9:48
around, but I've never actually um seen
9:51
one. And that new one is pretty slick
9:54
and pretty discreet. You know, I don't
9:56
think it's accidental that they make
9:58
this so it could really look like
9:59
anything. People just say, "Oh, it's
10:00
just some box or whatever hanging
10:02
around." Crazy.
10:04
Yes, sir.
10:05
Yeah. I'm I'm excited. I'm excited to
10:08
try it out and I'm excited to do the
10:09
next episode. But hey, if anybody's used
10:12
a pineapple before or if anybody has any
10:15
questions or if anybody wants to um ask
10:19
questions about what it's capable of, uh
10:22
we can definitely do a follow-up episode
10:24
to some comments um under the episode
10:26
and we'll definitely uh respond to you.
10:29
Yeah, send us some comments. We can have
10:30
some fun with this stuff. All right,
10:33
Adam. Very good. This has been fun.
10:35
Another interesting uh little toy you
10:37
got.
10:38
Yes, thank you. and uh looking forward
10:40
to uh continuing this series.
10:43
That's right. Okay, everyone. Thanks for
10:44
watching. Thanks, Adam.
10:47
Thank you. Bye. Bye, guys.

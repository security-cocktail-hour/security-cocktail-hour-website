## Content Structure

After the front matter, write your article content using Markdown:

```markdown
---
# Front matter here
---

Opening paragraph that hooks the reader and introduces the topic.

## Main Section Heading

Content for this section with **bold text** and *italic text* as needed.

### Subsection

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

## Key Takeaways

- Important point 1
- Important point 2
- Important point 3

## Conclusion

Wrap up the article with final thoughts and call to action.
```

---

## Recommended Categories

Use consistent categories to help readers find related content:

- **AI Security**
- **Cloud Security**
- **CISO Leadership**
- **Compliance & Governance**
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**
- **Data Protection**
- **Incident Response**
- **Penetration Testing**
- **SOC Operations**
- **Supply Chain Security**
- **Zero Trust**

*You can create new categories as needed, but try to reuse existing ones for consistency.*

---

## Tag Guidelines

Tags provide more granular topic classification:

- Use **lowercase** for consistency (e.g., "aws", "kubernetes", "phishing")
- Keep tags **specific** (e.g., "ransomware" instead of "malware")
- Limit to **3-8 tags** per article
- Reuse existing tags when possible

**Example tags**: `["zero-trust", "aws", "identity-management", "compliance", "nist"]`

---

## Images (Optional)

**Note**: The current blog design does not display featured images on blog cards or article pages. The `image` field in front matter is not currently used but can be left in place for future use.

If you want to add images within your article content, you can use standard Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text description](/images/blog/inline-image.jpg)
```

Place images in `/static/images/blog/` and they will display inline within the article content.

---

## Featured Posts on Homepage

To feature an article on the homepage:

1. Set `featured: true` in the front matter
2. Maximum 2 featured posts will display
3. Most recent featured posts are shown first
4. Featured section only appears if at least 1 featured post exists

---

## Related Episode Feature

**Added**: November 27, 2025

### Purpose
Links blog posts to their related podcast episodes, creating bidirectional topic clusters for improved SEO and user navigation.

### Usage

Add the `related_episode` parameter to your blog post front matter with the episode filename:

```yaml
related_episode: "episode-63-cybersecurity-at-nanosecond-speed-securing-high-frequency-trading"
```

### How It Works

1. **Front Matter**: Add `related_episode` with the episode filename (without `.md` extension)
2. **Auto-Population**: The component automatically fetches episode data (title, guest) from the episode's front matter
3. **Display**: Shows a professional card component with:
   - Episode title
   - Guest name (if available)
   - Link to full episode page
   - Hover effects for interactivity

### Design

The related episode component appears near the top of the blog post (after description box, before article content) with:
- Professional card styling with gradient background
- Compact design that doesn't dominate article content
- "🎙️ Related Episode" badge
- Arrow icon that animates on hover

### Reverse Linking

For best SEO results, also add a link from the episode transcript back to the blog post:

```markdown
**Related Blog Post**: [Post Title](/blog/post-slug/)
```

This creates bidirectional links that improve crawlability and user navigation.

## Author Information

**Enhanced**: November 27, 2025

### Setting Author Profile

```yaml
author: "Joe Patti"
author_bio: "Joe Patti is a cybersecurity practitioner with over 30 years of experience securing highly visible organizations in the Fortune 500, AmLaw 100 and government. He is co-host of the Security Cocktail Hour podcast."
author_twitter: "@SecCocktailHour"
author_linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-patti-infosec/"
```

### E-E-A-T Signals

The author fields provide E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) signals for search engines:

- **author_bio**: Establishes credentials and expertise
- **author_twitter**: Social media verification via Schema.org sameAs
- **author_linkedin**: Professional verification via Schema.org sameAs

These fields enhance the Schema.org Person markup for the post author, which can improve search engine understanding and potentially enhance search result display.

   - Description and image (if available)

2. **BreadcrumbList Schema** with:

### Meta Description Best Practices

- **URL slug** is auto-generated from title

### Content Structure for SEO

**Added**: November 27, 2025

Best practices for blog post content:

   - Improves readability and scannability
   - Helps search engines understand content structure
   - Increases chances of featured snippets

2. **Key Takeaways Section**: Include a summary list (good for featured snippets)

3. **Internal Links**: Link to related episodes and other blog posts

4. **Paragraph Length**: Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences) for readability

5. **Lists**: Use bullet points and numbered lists for easy scanning

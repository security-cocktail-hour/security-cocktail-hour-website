8. Full Description
In part 2 of our discussion, John Strand tells us how the cybersecurity industry has turned stagnant, with a lack of innovation and an investment model that isn't going to turn that around any time soon. We explore why venture capital funding hasn't led to the breakthrough products the industry needs, and what's holding back real innovation. John also highlights the leaders in the security industry who are actively giving back to the community, and he and Adam try to one-up each other over who's stayed in the most disgusting hotel room.

      <p>
        Hosts Joe Patti and Adam Roth realized years ago that some of the best professional development
        they ever received came from conversations with fellow cybersecurity pros—often over a drink or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the most experienced cybersecurity veterans only ever work in a handful of areas of this broad field.
        The Security Cocktail Hour Podcast showcases their journeys, insights, and lessons from across the
        cybersecurity spectrum, shared by the people who learned them in the kind of relaxed atmosphere you'll
        find at a conference bar. There are always new colleagues to meet and new insights to hear, as well as
        great stories you'll want to pass on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're building your security career, leading a team, or working alongside security pros,
        join us for candid conversations with pros across the field.

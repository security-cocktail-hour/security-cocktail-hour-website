# Security Cocktail Hour Website Redesign
## Project Handoff Document

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Project Status:** Content Export Phase (Day 1)  
**Timeline:** 14 days to launch (GoDaddy contract renewal deadline)

---

## CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT

### What We're Building
Redesigning the Security Cocktail Hour podcast website from GoDaddy Website Builder (template-based, expensive, limited) to a modern static site on GoDaddy cPanel hosting.

### Key Constraints
- **Timeline:** 14 days to launch
- **Hosting:** Must work with GoDaddy cPanel (standard shared hosting)
- **Maintainability:** Must be manageable with HTML/CSS/basic JavaScript skills
- **Technology:** Static site generator (Hugo or 11ty - Claude Code will select)
- **Build Tool:** Claude Code

---

## DECISIONS MADE ✅

### Technology Stack
- **Platform:** Static site generator (Hugo or 11ty)
- **Hosting:** GoDaddy cPanel (staying with current provider)
- **Email Marketing:** Mailchimp (free tier, up to 500 subscribers)
- **Deployment:** Build locally, upload via FTP/SFTP
- **Content:** Markdown files for episodes and pages

### Design Approach
- **Layout/Functionality:** APPROVED ✅
  - Homepage mockup layout approved (see artifact: homepage_mockup)
  - All essential elements confirmed
  - Component types confirmed (cards, buttons, forms, navigation)
- **Visual Design:** NOT FINAL - will be refined with Claude Code
  - Colors, typography, spacing to be determined during implementation
  - User wants to see these with real content before finalizing
  - Initial color suggestions were rejected - don't assume logo colors = website colors

### Content Decisions
- **All 60-70 episodes** to be migrated at launch
- **NO decade grouping** (was platform limitation) - unified searchable library
- **Single store page** with external links (two stores was platform limitation)
- **Support Us page** NOT critical for Day 1 - defer to Phase 2
- **Transcripts:** 
  - Only small number of episodes currently have transcripts
  - Template MUST support transcripts (capability required)
  - Migrate existing transcripts at launch
  - Easy to add more transcripts post-launch
  - Display gracefully when transcript not available

### URL Structure
- Episodes: `/episodes/[slug]` (e.g., `/episodes/wifi-pineapple-unboxing`)
- About: `/about` (combines podcast story + host bios)
- Resources: `/resources` (new feature)
- Store: `/store` (single page, external links)
- Contact: `/contact`

### What's Still Needed ⚠️

**XLSX Verification:**
- Need to see XLSX structure (can't read XLSX files in chat)

- Need to verify: `metadata_eps_61-70.xlsx`

**Transcript Files:**
- Need `episodes-with-transcripts.txt` (list of which episodes have transcripts)
- Need one example transcript file (e.g., `transcript-ep-59.txt`)

**Remaining Content Export:**
- Episode metadata (filling in the XLSX files from current site)
- Episode cover images (60-70 images)
- Logo (high-res - user has this)
- Host photos (high-res - user has these)
- Gallery photos (key photos to start)

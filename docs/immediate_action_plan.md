## üí° Tips for Working with Claude Code

### Best Practices:

1. **Be Specific**
   - Share the requirements and design docs
   - Reference specific sections when asking for implementation
   - Provide examples from current site

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Start with one page template
   - Get it working
   - Then move to next page
   - Don't try to do everything at once

3. **Test Frequently**
   - Build and preview often
   - Test on mobile and desktop
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Version Control**
   - Commit after each working feature
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Allows easy rollback if needed

5. **Ask for Explanations**
   - If you don't understand something Claude Code generates
   - Ask for explanation
   - Ask for alternatives if needed

### Example Claude Code Conversations:

**Initial Setup:**
```
"I need to build a podcast website using a static site generator. 
I have detailed requirements and design specs. The site needs to:
- Host 60-70 episodes with full metadata
- Have search and filter functionality
- Work on standard cPanel hosting (GoDaddy)
- Be fast and SEO-optimized

Which static site generator do you recommend and why?
Please initialize the project structure."
```

**First Template:**
```
"Let's build the homepage template. Here's what it needs:
[paste homepage requirements from design spec]

Use these colors from our logo:
- Red: #C8534B
- Blue: #1E4D8B
- Cyan: #3BA0D4

Please create the homepage HTML template with proper semantic markup
and CSS using our color palette."
```

**Episode Content Structure:**
```
"I need to set up the content structure for 60+ podcast episodes.
Each episode needs:
- Title, guest name, date, duration
- Description (SEO-optimized)
- Full transcript
- Links to multiple podcast platforms
- Category/topic tags
- Cover image

What's the best way to structure this content in [Hugo/11ty]?
Please create the content template and example files."
```

## üö® Blockers to Watch For

### Potential Issues:

1. **Content Export Problems**
   - If GoDaddy Website Builder makes export difficult
   - May need to copy/paste manually
   - Can be time-consuming but necessary

2. **Hosting Compatibility**
   - If cPanel doesn't support something needed
   - Have backup hosting plan ready (Netlify, Vercel)

3. **Transcript Volume**
   - 60-70 transcripts is a lot of content
   - May need scripting to organize
   - Claude Code can help with batch processing

4. **Image Optimization**
   - 60-70 episode cover images need optimization
   - Don't want to slow down site
   - Plan to compress before upload

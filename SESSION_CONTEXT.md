  - SEO Impact: Differentiates About page from Homepage in search results

  - Paths fixed: /episodes, /blog, /about, /contact, /resources, /partnership, /privacy, /terms

### Repository Information

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/security-cocktail-hour/security-cocktail-hour-website
**Branch**: `main`
**Remote**: `origin`

### Making Changes & Deploying

Netlify is configured for **automatic deployments**. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a new build and deployment.

   ```

2. **Test changes locally** - Browse at http://localhost:1313/

3. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   git push
   ```

4. **Automatic deployment** - Netlify detects push, builds site, deploys to staging (~1-2 minutes)

5. **Verify deployment** - Check https://app.netlify.com/

### Netlify Build Configuration

```toml
[build]
  command = "hugo --minify"

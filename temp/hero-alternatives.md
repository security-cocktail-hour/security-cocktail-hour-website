# Hero Section Right Panel - Design Alternatives

The current design has a subtle circle outline on the cyan panel. Here are alternative treatments:

## Current Design
- Faint circle outline (decorative, echoes logo badge)
- Very subtle, minimal visual weight
- **Issue**: Looks like it might be a placeholder

## Alternative Options

### Option 1: Bold Circle with Pattern
- Large circle with radiating lines (like logo background)
- More prominent, clearly intentional
- Could include microphone icon or sound wave

### Option 2: Martini Glass Illustration
- Large stylized martini glass (matching logo)
- Could be line art or silhouette
- Directly reinforces brand identity

### Option 3: Geometric Pattern Only
- Remove circle entirely
- Use diagonal stripes or geometric shapes
- Keep it abstract and modern

### Option 4: Latest Episode Preview
- Show latest episode artwork in circular frame
- Functional and decorative
- Immediately shows what podcast is about

### Option 5: No Circle
- Just the diagonal cyan split
- Clean, minimal
- Let the geometry speak for itself

## Recommendation
I'll create updated versions showing Options 1, 2, and 5 so you can compare.
